Project Proposal

Overview
My proposal is to develop a vertical scrolling spaceship Shoot 'em up video game with collision detection

Background
The Shoot 'em up genre, which is a division of Action genre, has vast amount of software. I have worked on a Shoot 'em up built in C++ but the project fell through the cracks and not much progress was put into it. The project will contain no code that I have previously written. I have reviewed other Ruby projects and briefly went over the chosen references.

Significance
My project is worth doing because just like films, it will have benefits for others in its base by distracting people from the real world. Also it will give people a way to try something they couldn't experience in real life. I hope to learn more about what it takes to develop a video game and learn more about Ruby. 

Deliverables
- Skeleton: 	Movable Ship – 2 hours
				Firing Ship – 1 hour
				Floating Objects – 1 hour

- Basic:		Collision Detection – 5 hours
			
- Solid:		Single Enemy A.I. – 4 hours
		
- Awesome:		Different Enemy A.I. – 2 hours
				Level Set, Continues Play – 4 hours

Tools
The language I am planning on using is Ruby, Aptana with the 2d game development library Gosu, and windows executable creation with OCRA (One-Click Ruby Application). The main reason for choosing these over the alternatives is they have the largest community so it will be easier to get help if I run into problems.  

Possible Problems
I expect problems with getting familiar with Ruby, but with the references I have I should be able to overcome them.  Another problem possibly could be getting Gosu working with the Aptana Studio 3, there are helpful guides so and a lot of people to help.
